# SafeSocial --- Haze the Hate

A chrome extension used to block hateful and offensive comments on social media sites such as Youtube and Twitter

### Problem Statement
1. In today's world, we are more connected than ever. The internet is an amazing way to connect to those close to us, however, it is also used to spread hateful messages to others. 
2. Our inspiration was taken from a surprisingly common issue among YouTubers and other people prominent on social media: That negative comments (even from anonymous strangers) hurts more than people realize. There have been cases of YouTubers developing mental illnesses like depression as a result of consistently receiving negative (and hateful) comments on the internet. 
3. We decided that this overlooked issue deserved to be brought to attention and that we could develop a solution not only for these individuals but the rest of us as well who often come across such disturbing comments while casually browsing through these social media

### Challenges we faced
1. Making the model and working with chrome extension (version 3) for the first time in 24 hours was extremely challenging
2. It was difficult censoring comments on YouTube and Twitter as for both the social media the approach was different
3. Integration of FastAPI and Chrome extension was extremely tedious

### Technology Stack
1. Front end: HTML, CSS, Javascript to make pop-ups
2. Programming Languages: Python (TensorFlow and Keras)
3. Designing tools : Canva
4. Version Control : Git and GitHub
5. Backend: FastAPI and PostmanAPI for testing
