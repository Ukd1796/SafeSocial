# SafeSocial --- Haze the Hate

A chrome extension used to block hateful and offensive comments on social media sites such as Youtube and Twitter

### Problem Statement
-- In today's world, we are more connected than ever. The internet is an amazing way to connect to those close to us, however, it is also used to spread hateful messages to others. 
-- Our inspiration was taken from a surprisingly common issue among YouTubers and other people prominent on social media: That negative comments (even from anonymous strangers) hurts more than people realize. There have been cases of YouTubers developing mental illnesses like depression as a result of consistently receiving negative (and hateful) comments on the internet. 
-- We decided that this overlooked issue deserved to be brought to attention and that we could develop a solution not only for these individuals but the rest of us as well who often come across such disturbing comments while casually browsing through these social media

### Challenges we faced
-- Making the model and working with chrome extension (version 3) for the first time in 24 hours was extremely challenging
-- It was difficult censoring comments on YouTube and Twitter as for both the social media the approach was different
-- Integration of FastAPI and Chrome extension was extremely tedious

### Technology Stack
-- Front end: HTML, CSS, Javascript to make pop-ups
-- Programming Languages: Python (TensorFlow and Keras)
-- Designing tools : Canva
-- Version Control : Git and GitHub
-- Backend: FastAPI and PostmanAPI for testing
